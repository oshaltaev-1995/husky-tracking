# About

This project started as a demo to explore a real operational problem in sled dog kennels: workload can become uneven across dogs, and building balanced teams under time pressure is hard.

The app provides an at-a-glance view of daily/weekly workload, highlights risky patterns (e.g., long work streaks or high rolling totals), and helps form teams using explainable rules and constraints.

The current version is a practical baseline (rule-based). It is intentionally simple and transparent so that kennel staff can trust the outputs and adjust thresholds when needed.
