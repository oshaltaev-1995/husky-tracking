# Husky Workload Monitoring & Analysis Demo

This project is a prototype web application for monitoring and analyzing the workload of sled dogs in a real kennel environment.

The system helps kennel management understand how dogs are actually used over time, detect workload imbalance, identify potential overload risks, and support daily decisions when forming sled teams.

The demo is based on real-world operational logic and manual workload records, not on idealized laboratory assumptions. It is designed as a decision-support tool, not as a control or medical system.
