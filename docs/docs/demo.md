# Demo Overview

## What the system does

The demo application provides a visual and analytical overview of sled dogs’ workload at both individual dog level and kennel level.

It aggregates daily work records into meaningful indicators that help identify patterns such as overuse, underuse, long work streaks, or insufficient recovery periods. Based on these indicators, the system highlights potential risk situations and supports team planning.

The demo represents a **baseline rule-based system** that works without machine learning and can be used immediately with existing data.

## Key Features

### Kennel-Level Overview
- Aggregated workload statistics for the entire kennel
- Heatmaps showing work intensity over time
- Quick identification of uneven workload distribution

### Individual Dog Profiles
- Daily, weekly, and monthly workload summaries
- Visualization of work streaks and rest periods
- Highlighted risk indicators based on configurable thresholds

### Rule-Based Risk Detection
- Work streak length (consecutive working days)
- Rest streak length
- Share of working days over a selected period
- Rolling 7-day workload totals

All alerts are **explainable** and based on transparent rules.

### Team Builder (Decision Support)
- Supports forming sled teams based on current workload
- Helps avoid repeated overuse of the same dogs
- Balances work across available dogs

### Data Interaction
- Manual data input directly through the interface
- Import of workload data from Excel files
- Export of summaries and reports for further analysis

## What this demo is (and is not)

- ✅ A practical decision-support prototype  
- ✅ Based on real operational logic  
- ❌ Not a medical or injury prediction system  
- ❌ Not an automated control system  

The demo serves as a foundation for further development and research.
